# [SuitandTies] (https://leungk712.github.io/SuitandTies/)

This project is focused on a fictional store called Suit & Ties (S&T), a fashion store that sells men's casual/business clothing.

As of 7/15/19, S&T has a simple layout for desktops. Media queries will be added, alongside content for the different nav links.
